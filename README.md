# Fine Tuning ResNet50 for Bird Breed Classification
## Overview

This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of the ResNet50 model for bird breed classification based on an existing dataset from Kaggle. ResNet50, a pre-trained deep learning model developed by Microsoft, is fine-tuned on a custom dataset to classify birds into 575 predefined categories. The project covers the entire workflow from data preprocessing, model adaptation, training, and evaluation.
